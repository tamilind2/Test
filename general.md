### Penetration Testing Report

#### Findings: Key Expiration Date Modification and Lack of Expiration Policy in Azure Key Vault

- **Discovery of Azure Key Vault**:
  - The attacker identified the Azure Key Vault using Azure CLI commands to enumerate resources within the subscription.
  - Command executed: `az keyvault list --output table`
  - This allowed the attacker to locate and target the Key Vault for further exploitation.

- **Modification of Key Expiration Date**:
  - The attacker, with sufficient access, was able to modify the expiration date of Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) stored in the Azure Key Vault.
  - Command executed: `az keyvault key set-attributes --vault-name <KeyVaultName> --name <KeyName> --expires <NewExpirationDate>`
  - By altering the key expiration date, the attacker could extend the validity of a key, preventing it from expiring as intended.

- **Lack of Enforced Key Expiration and Rotation Policies**:
  - There is a lack of enforced policies to ensure regular key expiration and rotation within the Key Vault.
  - The absence of such policies means keys could remain active beyond their intended lifecycle, increasing the risk of key compromise and unauthorized access.
  - Automated key rotation may not be configured or enforced, leading to prolonged exposure of potentially compromised keys.

- **Potential Impact**:
  - **Key Misuse**: Modified expiration dates could allow the attacker to use the keys indefinitely, leading to unauthorized access to encrypted data.
  - **Extended Exposure**: Without enforced key rotation, the risk of key exposure increases over time, as compromised keys remain valid.
  - **Compliance Issues**: Failure to enforce key expiration and rotation policies may lead to non-compliance with security standards and regulations, increasing the risk of data breaches.

#### Recommendations:

- **Enforce Key Expiration Policies**: Implement and enforce policies to regularly check and validate key expiration dates, ensuring keys are invalidated and rotated as needed.
- **Automate Key Rotation (If Not Already Implemented)**: Configure automated processes to rotate CMKs periodically, reducing the risk of key compromise over time. If automation is not possible, establish a manual process with strict adherence to rotation schedules.
- **Restrict Modification Permissions**: Limit permissions for modifying key attributes, such as expiration dates, to a minimal set of trusted users to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Monitor Key Vault Activities**: Enable detailed logging and monitoring of all activities within the Key Vault, including changes to key attributes, and set up alerts for suspicious actions.

#### Conclusion:
The vulnerabilities identified in the Azure Key Vault, including the ability to modify key expiration dates and the lack of enforced key expiration and rotation policies, significantly increase the risk of key misuse and data exposure. Implementing the recommended controls will mitigate these risks and enhance the security of key management practices within the Azure environment.






## Subject: Azure DevOps Pen Test Results - Clarification on AWS Findings

Dear Senior Management Team,

This email aims to provide clarification regarding the recent penetration testing (pen test) conducted on our Azure DevOps platform, where ADO agents are hosted within EKS. While the pen test identified several findings, there is a specific point to address concerning the AWS environment and MFA.

The pen test identified findings related to the AWS environment and MFA. It is crucial to note, however, that these findings were previously discovered during a separate pen test and are already known issues. These findings are not specific to the Azure DevOps platform but are rather applicable to all services utilizing the AWS cloud.

Therefore, the focus of subsequent pen testing activities for the Azure DevOps platform should be on addressing the newly identified findings within that specific environment. The existing AWS findings will be addressed through a separate remediation plan.

By concentrating on the Azure DevOps platform findings, we can ensure a more streamlined and targeted approach to enhancing the security posture of this critical system.

I am readily available to discuss this further and provide any additional information you may require.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Following the recent penetration testing activity conducted on our Azure DevOps (ADO) platform, I would like to provide some important clarifications regarding the findings.

During the testing, several issues related to our AWS environment and multi-factor authentication (MFA) were identified. I want to emphasize that these particular findings are not exclusive to our ADO platform. These issues had been previously identified during other penetration testing activities and are recognized vulnerabilities within our AWS infrastructure.

It is crucial to note that the primary objective of this pen testing exercise was to assess the security posture of our ADO platform specifically. The issues discovered pertaining to the AWS environment and MFA are well-known and are being addressed as part of our broader AWS security strategy. These vulnerabilities are not unique to the ADO platform but affect all services utilizing AWS.

Moving forward, I recommend that our penetration testing scenarios remain focused on the specific platform under review to ensure that the findings are directly relevant and actionable for that platform. This approach will help us maintain a clear and precise understanding of security risks and remediation efforts for each platform individually.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further details.



I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss a critical issue we face in our development environment: the management and security of various types of secrets, and the importance of effective consequence management. Additionally, I would like to introduce a reliable desktop vaulting solution to address this challenge.

The Issue: Managing Developer Secrets and Consequence Management
Developers frequently handle sensitive information, often referred to as "secrets," which are crucial for accessing various services and systems. Below is a brief description of the various types of secrets that need to be managed securely:

API Keys:

Description: API keys are used to authenticate requests to third-party services, ensuring that the requests are coming from authorized sources.
Examples: Google Maps API key, Stripe API key.
Database Credentials:

Description: These include usernames and passwords required to access and interact with databases.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL credentials.
Encryption Keys:

Description: Encryption keys are used for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data, ensuring that data remains confidential and secure.
Examples: AES keys, RSA private keys.
Service Account Credentials:

Description: Credentials used by service accounts to access cloud services or other automated systems, allowing applications to interact with these services securely.
Examples: AWS IAM credentials, Google Cloud service account keys.
OAuth Tokens:

Description: Tokens used for OAuth authentication flows, allowing users to grant applications limited access to their resources without sharing passwords.
Examples: GitHub personal access tokens, OAuth access tokens for Google APIs.
SSH Keys:

Description: SSH keys are used to establish secure connections and authenticate users to remote servers.
Examples: Private SSH key for accessing remote servers.
Configuration Secrets:

Description: Sensitive configuration settings required by applications to operate correctly, often including service endpoints and feature flags.
Examples: SMTP server credentials, sensitive feature flags.
Challenges:

Risk of Exposure: Hardcoding secrets in source code or storing them in unsecured files increases the risk of accidental exposure.
Accidental Commits: Secrets can be inadvertently committed to version control systems like Git, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
Environment Specificity: Different environments (development, testing, production) require different secrets, complicating management.
Human Error: Mismanagement or mishandling of secrets can lead to security breaches.
Consequence Management:

One critical aspect often overlooked is that developers are not always properly trained in consequence management. This lack of training can have significant repercussions:

Data Breaches: Exposure of sensitive data can lead to severe security incidents.
Compliance Violations: Non-compliance with regulatory requirements can result in legal penalties and loss of trust.
Operational Disruption: Unauthorized access to critical systems can disrupt operations and lead to downtime.
Reputation Damage: Security breaches can damage the company's reputation and erode customer trust.
Proposed Solution: Desktop Vaulting Tool
To mitigate these risks and enhance our security posture, I recommend using a desktop vaulting tool like 1Password. Unlike cloud-based solutions, a desktop vaulting tool provides the following benefits:

Local Storage: Secrets are stored locally on your machine, reducing dependency on cloud services and enhancing control over sensitive data.
Secure Access: Secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed through authenticated sessions.
Integration: 1Password integrates seamlessly with development workflows, allowing developers to securely reference secrets in environment variables.
How to Use 1Password for Secret Management:

Store Secrets Securely:

Store API keys, database credentials, encryption keys, and other secrets in 1Password vaults.
Organize secrets by project or environment for easy access and management.
Access Secrets via CLI:

Use the 1Password CLI tool (op) to fetch secrets and export them to environment variables dynamically.
Example:
sh
Copy code
export DB_PASSWORD=$(op item get "Database Password" --fields password)
Integrate with Development Tools:

Integrate 1Password with your development environment (e.g., IDEs, CI/CD pipelines) to ensure secrets are securely accessed during development and deployment processes.
Conclusion
By adopting a desktop vaulting tool like 1Password, we can significantly improve our management of sensitive secrets, reduce the risk of exposure, and streamline our development workflows. Effective consequence management through proper secret handling will mitigate potential data breaches, ensure compliance, and maintain operational integrity. It is also crucial to provide our developers with adequate training on the importance of consequence management to further enhance our security practices.
